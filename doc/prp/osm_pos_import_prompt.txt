Prompt:

OSM POS Import

You are an experienced Java/Spring Boot backend engineer and you help me implement a small feature in an existing project.

Project (context):
- CampusCoffee backend
- Multi-module Maven project with ports-and-adapters:
  -'api' = controllers
  - 'application' = Spring Boot app/orchestration
  -'data' = persistence adaptor
  - 'domain' = domain model + business logic

Goal:
Implement an endpoint that creates a POS from an OpenStreetMap node:
- POST /api/pos/import/osm/{osmNodeId}

Expected behaviour:
1. When the endpoint is called, the backend fetches OSM XML from
   'https://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/node/{osmNodeId}'.

2. It parses the 'tag' elements, specifically:
   - 'name'
   - 'addr:street'
   - 'addr:housenumber'
   - 'addr:postcode'
   - 'addr:city'

3. These values are mapped to the existing POS domain model (name, street, houseNumber, postalCode, city, type, campus).

4. Save the POS via the existing repository/port.

5. The endpoint returns HTTP 201 and the created POS as JSON.
6. Typical errors (node not found, missing important tags, OSM/network errors) should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages.

Your Constraints:
- Use the existing package structure and naming conventins.
- The controller in 'api' should stay thin and delegate to a service in 'application' (or a suitable place in 'domain').
- Use a standard HTTP client (e.g. RestTemplate or WebClient).
- Keep the ports-and-adapters idea intact (no direct framework calls from 'domain').

I want you to respond like this:
1.First briefly explain what you want to change and why.
2. Then show only the relevant code blocks with file paths.
3.Suggest small, incremental steps that I can apply and commit one by one.
4. Please also give simple test instructions, e.g. concrete curl commands I can run.
